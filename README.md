# VBA Stock Analysis Refractoring Code

## Overview 
Refractored Code to be able to run through multiple stocks efficiently. 

### Purpose
To loop through all the data at one time in order to collect information. 

## Analysis and Challenges
After refactoring the code, it seems to take longer than my initial project.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I got a lot of error messages while working on this challenge. Most were out of range errors. I had to redo code even if it looked correct. I honestly was going to skip this challenge because I was having so many problems. 

## Results
There still may be some bugs in the code. The buttons get an error message when I try to use them, but I can run the program from the macro. 
I don't know that it stops running once it starts. The timer gets some really long times if I don't stop the script before rerunning it. Poor Steve.
Any feedback is appreciated. I'm just trying to understand as much as I can.
